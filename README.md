# AI Agents with LangGraph - Testing Project

This project explores AI agent capabilities using LangGraph and demonstrates the ReACT (Reasoning + Acting) methodology with Azure OpenAI integration. This is based on DeepLearning course 
https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains experimental code for testing LangGraph functionality and building AI agents that can:
- Perform multi-step reasoning using the ReACT pattern
- Execute actions (calculations, data lookups)
- Maintain conversation history
- Handle complex queries requiring multiple tool calls

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- **Custom Agent Implementation**: Manual agent class with conversation memory
- **ReACT Methodology**: Thought â†’ Action â†’ Pause â†’ Observation â†’ Answer pattern
- **Tool Integration**: Calculator and dog breed weight lookup functions
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Uses LangChain's AzureChatOpenAI
- **Automated Query Loop**: Processes multi-step queries automatically
